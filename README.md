# Identification-of-highly-drunk-people-using-openpose
This program identifies highly drunk people among others. Individual people are being tracked using deep sort algorithm. 

# Run the program 

1 - Create OpenPose - API \n
2 - Download all files from the Repository \n
3 - Run the Jupyter Notebook or .py file on any video \n


# Compiling pyopenpose
Follow the instructions on this link.

PS: If you are note using a GUI interface, it's important to turn on the python flag cmake -DBUILD_PYTHON=ON .. before compile OpenPose from your build directory.

Please note that the full program is under development and I have used a lot of references from some amazing people.
